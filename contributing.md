# contributing to _awesome-svelte-resources_

Hi, welcome!
This repo tries to aggregate the Svelte community's resources
as best it can within the limitations of a single markdown file.
Eventually,
[an official website](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/1070)
will probably supplant this project,
but until then, your help is appreciated in organizing information
for this growing community.

Please feel free to open any issues or pull requests you think are appropriate.
This project's maintainers are open to
discussion and questioning its assumptions.
The following kinds of resources are currently not included:

- unofficial blog posts, learning resources,
  and other media not affiliated with the Svelte team
- closed-source showcase apps
- Sapper (we'd definitely link to a similar aggregation
  project if someone creates it)

## notes for contributors

- Project names formatted with `backticks` should be installable via
  [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), and include any user/org scope.
- **Bold text** is reserved for official Svelte resources.
- Project descriptions should fit on a single line on GitHub's desktop layout.
- If a project fails to meet acceptable quality standards,
  please open an issue or PR to discuss removing it.
