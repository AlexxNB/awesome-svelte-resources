# contributing to awesome-svelte-resources

Hi, welcome! We're glad you stopped by.
This project tries to represent Svelte's community and resources as best it can,
given the limitations of a single markdown file.
Eventually, [a featureful website](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/1070)
will probably supplant this project,
but until then, your help is appreciated to assist organizing information
for this awesome and growing community.

Please feel free to open any issues or pull requests you think are appropriate.
This project's maintainers are open to
discussion and questioning any assumptions.
